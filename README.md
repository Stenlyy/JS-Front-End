 <h1>About the Course</h1>
    <p>In the "JS Front-End" course, I acquired foundational knowledge in JavaScript, including syntax, working with arrays and objects, as well as writing functions. My understanding of asynchronous programming deepened, and I learned to manipulate the DOM and handle events. I am now familiar with functional and object-oriented programming approaches and can perform data transmissions over HTTP and REST.</p>
